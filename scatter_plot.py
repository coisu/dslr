1. House Comparison for a Specific Subject
Objective: Compare the average grades of two different houses (e.g., Gryffindor and Slytherin) in a specific subject (e.g., Potions).
Approach:
Calculate the average grade for each house in the selected subject.
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the average grade of Gryffindor and the y-axis represents the average grade of Slytherin.
Analyze the closeness of the points to determine similarity in performance.
2. Correlation of Two Subjects
Objective: Analyze the relationship between grades in two different subjects for all students.
Approach:
Select two subjects (e.g., Math and Potions).
Create a scatter plot where each point represents a student, with the x-axis showing grades in Math and the y-axis showing grades in Potions.
This plot will help visualize if students who perform well in one subject also perform well in another, indicating a similarity in performance across subjects.
3. Individual Student Performance Across Subjects
Objective: Evaluate the performance of individual students across multiple subjects.
Approach:
Calculate the total or average grade for each student across all subjects.
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the average grade across two selected subjects (e.g., Math and Charms) for each student.
Each point represents a student, helping identify whether there are similarities in their performance across these subjects.
4. Trends in Performance by Age or Birthday
Objective: Investigate if there is a similarity in performance based on age or birthday.
Approach:
Extract the age of students from their birthdates.
Plot a scatter plot where the x-axis represents age and the y-axis represents grades in a specific subject (e.g., Defense Against the Dark Arts).
This will help analyze if students of similar ages perform similarly in that subject.
5. Comparison of Two Groups (e.g., by Gender)
Objective: Compare performance between two demographic groups (e.g., male and female students) in a specific subject.
Approach:
Select a subject and calculate the average grades for male and female students.
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents average grades of male students and the y-axis represents average grades of female students.
This allows you to visualize and analyze performance differences or similarities between the two groups.
6. Comparison of Student Birthdays Across Houses
Objective: Analyze if there are similarities in the distribution of birthdays among students from different houses (e.g., Gryffindor vs. Slytherin).
Approach:
Convert students' birth dates into a numeric format (e.g., days of the year).
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the birthday (day of the year) of Gryffindor students and the y-axis represents the birthday of Slytherin students.
This will help visualize any patterns or similarities in birthday distributions between the two houses.
7. Age Distribution of Students in Each House
Objective: Compare the ages of students across different houses.
Approach:
Calculate the age of each student based on their birthday.
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the ages of Gryffindor students and the y-axis represents the ages of Slytherin students.
This will help determine if the age distributions are similar between the two houses.
8. Performance by Birth Month
Objective: Analyze the average performance in a specific subject based on the month of birth.
Approach:
Group students by the month of their birthday and calculate the average grade for a subject (e.g., Potions).
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the month (numeric representation, e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February) and the y-axis represents the average grade for that month.
This helps visualize if students born in certain months perform similarly.
9. Birthday Month vs. Average Grades
Objective: Investigate the relationship between the month of birth and overall average grades.
Approach:
Calculate the average grades for students based on their birthday month.
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the month of birth and the y-axis represents the overall average grade.
This can show whether students born in certain months tend to have higher or lower grades, indicating a potential similarity.
10. Correlation of Multiple Courses by Birthday
Objective: Examine whether students born in the same month perform similarly across multiple subjects.
Approach:
Calculate the average grades across multiple subjects for each student and categorize them by their birth month.
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the average grades in one subject (e.g., Defense Against the Dark Arts) and the y-axis represents the average grades in another subject (e.g., Transfiguration), color-coded by birthday month.
This will help visualize any patterns in performance among students born in the same month across different subjects.
11. Comparison of Top 25% Scored Students Across Subjects
Objective: Analyze and compare the top 25% scored students in each subject, which can be done either by grouping them by house or considering all students together.
