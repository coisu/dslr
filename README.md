Discover Data Science through this project by recreating the Hogwarts Sorting Hat using logistic regression!

## Task Sequence
### Step 1: Data Analysis (describe.[extension])
> Objective: Calculate and output statistical summary information for the dataset.
    
- Tasks:

    - Read the dataset_train.csv file.
    - For each numerical feature, compute the following:
        - Count of data points, mean, standard deviation, minimum/maximum values, and quartiles.
    - Present the results in table format.

- Data Analysis (describe.py) Code Requirements
    > The describe.py script analyzes numerical data and calculates the following information:
    
    - Count: The number of data points.
    - Mean: The average of the data.
    - Standard Deviation (Std): A measure of data dispersion.
    - Minimum (Min): The smallest value in the data.
    - Maximum (Max): The largest value in the data.
    - Percentiles: The 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles.

Restrictions:

- Using Pandas' describe() function or similar built-in - functions is strictly prohibited.
- All calculations must be implemented manually.

### Step 2: Data Visualization
> Objective: Visually explore the data to understand relationships and characteristics of the features.
- Tasks:

    - Histogram:
        - displays a histogram answering the next question:
          
            _"Which Hogwarts course has a homogeneous score distribution between all four houses?"_

            ![Potions_histogram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdfcd5f6-4dc0-41df-ae16-cd08f71880c4)
            ![Care of Magical Creatures_histogram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faa0cb86-07a2-47d0-aef2-1e90be906018)
    - Scatter Plot:
        - displays a scatter plot answering the next question :
          
            _"What are the two features that are similar ?"_
          
    - Pair Plot:
        - Display relationships between multiple features simultaneously.
        - displays a pair plot or scatter plot matrix (according to the library that you are using).
            > From this visualization, what features are you going to use for your logistic regression?

### Step 3: Logistic Regression
> Objective: Use logistic regression to classify students into their respective houses.
- Tasks:

    - Model Training (logreg_train):
        - Train the model using the training dataset.
        Optimize weights using gradient descent.
    - Prediction (logreg_predict):
        - Predict the house for each student in the test dataset.
        Save the results in houses.csv format.

### Step 4: Review and Submission
> Objective: Test all functionalities to ensure proper operation and prepare for submission.
